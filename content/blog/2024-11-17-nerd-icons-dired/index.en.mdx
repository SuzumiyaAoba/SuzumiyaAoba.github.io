## TL;DR

If you use [Setup El](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SetupEl), add the following configuration.

```elisp
(setup nerd-icons-dired
  (:elpaca t)
  (:with-mode dired-mode
    (:hook nerd-icons-dired-mode))
  (:require nerd-icons)

  (add-to-list 'nerd-icons-extension-icon-alist
               '("mdx" nerd-icons-octicon "nf-oct-markdown" :face nerd-icons-lblue)))
```

## Motivation

On this blog, I mainly write articles in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) and generate HTML with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
I use [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) when writing articles.

I use [nerd-icons-dired](https://github.com/rainstormstudio/nerd-icons-dired) to display file icons in Emacs,
but the default configuration does not show icons for MDX files.
It is not a big problem, but seeing only a white square icon when switching buffers or viewing dired feels dull,
so I looked into how to customize it.

## Configuration

This is done by adding a value to `nerd-icons-extension-icon-alist` in `nerd-icons`, not `nerd-icons-dired`.
Install `nerd-icons` and `nerd-icons-dired` using the method that matches your package manager.

If you want a package-manager-agnostic version, it looks like this.

```elisp
(require 'nerd-icons)

(add-to-list 'nerd-icons-extension-icon-alist
    '("mdx" nerd-icons-octicon "nf-oct-markdown" :face nerd-icons-lblue))
```

You can find icon names by running `M-x nerd-icon-insert`, which shows a list of icons.
If you want to match existing icons, refer to the [nerd-icons code](https://github.com/rainstormstudio/nerd-icons.el/blob/0.1.0/nerd-icons.el#L86-L899).
