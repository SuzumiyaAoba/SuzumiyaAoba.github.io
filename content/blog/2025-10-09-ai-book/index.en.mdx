I have been reading several books for development with generative AI, so here are brief impressions and summaries.

## Finished

- [LLM Prompt Engineering - Building Generative AI Applications by the Creator of GitHub Copilot](https://amzn.to/46Mahsh)
- [Practical Introduction to AI Agents for Real-World Use (KS Information Science)](https://amzn.to/4h2sk0R)

## Unread

- [Practical LLM Application Development - A Comprehensive Guide Beyond Prototypes](https://amzn.to/46SWIWE)
- [Intuitive LLM - Hands-on Introduction to Large Language Models](https://amzn.to/4o4uxM9)
- [Learn by Building! LLM DIY Introduction](https://amzn.to/471JYwX)
- [Introduction to Large Language Models](https://amzn.to/4q34pCw)
- [Introduction to Large Language Models II - Implementing and Evaluating Generative LLMs](https://amzn.to/4nTDec4)

## LLM Prompt Engineering - Building Generative AI Applications by the Creator of GitHub Copilot

This book is written by someone who worked on GitHub Copilot.
After ChatGPT popularized chat-based applications, the most widely adopted LLM service was probably code completion like GitHub Copilot.
Reading this book reminded me again that LLMs fit well with code generation.

When I reread it to summarize, I noticed it has no table of contents. Maybe because I'm reading the Kindle edition.

Compared to the other book I introduce below, this one focuses less on concrete development of generative AI applications,
and more on the history of LLMs, techniques discovered so far, and concepts and ways of thinking you should know.
It touches on application design, but only at a flowchart-level of process flow,
so it does not teach concrete application development. This is also mentioned in Amazon reviews.

The original is the English book [Prompt Engineering for Llms: The Art and Science of Building Large Language Model-Based Applications](https://amzn.to/48qRxQj).
The English edition was published on 2024/12/31, while the Japanese translation was published on 2025/5/16, nearly half a year later.
Considering writing and publication, the content reflects the situation a few months before 2024/12/31.
For example, Anthropic announced MCP (Model Context Protocol) around November 2024, but it is not mentioned here.
While the idea of tool use existed before MCP, the book does not cover how the protocol has been standardizing since then,
so some information is already outdated.

That said, the sections on techniques for getting desired outputs and how LLMs behave are very informative.
If you want concrete AI agent development, this is not the best fit, but it is a good book for learning about LLMs and surrounding technologies.

## Practical Introduction to AI Agents for Real-World Use (KS Information Science)

This book describes more concrete implementation details than "LLM Prompt Engineering",
so it is likely to contain the information you want if you are trying to build real LLM applications.

The book is structured in three parts:

- Part 1 covers the technical components of AI agents comprehensively.
- Part 2 explains the OpenAI API, gives a brief intro to LangGraph used in the book, and presents four concrete use cases with implementations.
- Part 3 discusses evaluation, error analysis, risk, monitoring, and other topics needed for production.

Part 1 explains topics you should know for AI agent development:

- LLM
- Profile
- Tool calling
- Planning
- Self-correction
- Memory
- Workflow

Part 2 covers design and implementation of RAG and agents in these domains:

- Help desk
- Data analysis
- Information gathering
- Marketing

Part 3 explains evaluation, error analysis, UX, risk, monitoring, and quality improvements needed for deployment.

Overall, it covers the flow and components of AI agent development fairly well.
It includes code examples using LangGraph, but the code itself is not hard, so it is easy to get a sense of what is needed.

## Summary

If you want to learn concrete AI agent development, read [Practical Introduction to AI Agents for Real-World Use (KS Information Science)](https://amzn.to/4h2sk0R).
If you want knowledge about LLMs, their history, and techniques for using them, read
[LLM Prompt Engineering - Building Generative AI Applications by the Creator of GitHub Copilot](https://amzn.to/46I6qfR).
