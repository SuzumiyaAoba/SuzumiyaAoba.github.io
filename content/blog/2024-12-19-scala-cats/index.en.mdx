## Type classes

I will learn while noting the [type classes implemented in Cats](https://typelevel.org/cats/typeclasses.html#type-classes-in-cats).
I used scalaz long ago, but I stopped writing Scala around the time it split into Cats, so this is my first proper time using Cats.

The relationships between type classes are shown in the following diagram.
My current goal is to understand the definitions and capabilities of each type class.

As the diagram suggests, it is recommended to start with the highlighted type classes, so I will follow that.

## Environment

- Scala [3.3.4](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/3.3.4.html)
  - The latest LTS version at the time of writing
- cats [2.12.0](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/tree/v2.12.0)

## Series posts

In this series, we will learn each Cats type class in detail.
